- **Text-to-Speech**: speech T5 model, pyttsx3

#### System Requirements
1. **Voice Recognition**: Capture voice commands in noisy environments.
2. **API Development**: Robust API to connect AI with KFC menu data.
3. **Order Confirmation**: Verbal confirmation of order specifics and total cost.
4. **Upselling Capability**: Suggest premium meal options or add-ons.
5. **User Interface**: Support voice input, menu navigation, and receipt viewing.

#### Expected Deliverables
1. **Functionality**: Accurate voice-to-text conversion and real-time menu integration.
2. **User Interface**: Intuitive interface for order information and user interactions.
3. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on API integration, system architecture, LLM implementation, and user interaction workflow.
4. **Presentation**: Demonstration simulating typical order scenarios.

#### Evaluation Criteria
1. **Accuracy**: Precision in voice command interpretation and order accuracy.
2. **Responsiveness**: Efficiency in command processing and API interaction.
3. **User Experience**: Interface effectiveness and streamlined ordering process.
4. **Innovation**: Creative application of technology in system features.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
    - Set up the development environment.
    - Install required libraries and frameworks (Flask, LangChain, Google Speech Recognition, etc.).

2. **API Development**
    - Create a Flask API to interface with the KFC menu data stored in a CSV file.
    - Implement endpoints for fetching menu items, processing orders, and calculating total costs.

3. **Voice Recognition and Noise Reduction**
    - Integrate Google Speech Recognition for capturing voice commands.
    - Implement noise reduction using spectral gating to enhance voice command accuracy in noisy environments.

4. **Natural Language Processing**
    - Use LangChain to integrate with open-source LLMs (LLAMA, Mistral, ChatGPT) for processing voice-to-text inputs.
    - Load KFC menu data into the LLM for query responses.

5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
    - Use the speech T5 model for natural voice responses.
    - Integrate pyttsx3 as a fallback TTS solution.

6. **Frontend Development**
    - Create a login page for customer details using HTML and Flask.
    - Develop a menu page displaying items from the API and supporting voice input.
    - Add a microphone button for capturing voice commands.

7. **Order Confirmation and Upselling**
    - Implement verbal order confirmation and cost calculation.
    - Integrate a recommendation engine for suggesting premium meal options based on promotions or preferences.

8. **Testing and Validation**
    - Test the system for accuracy in voice recognition, order processing, and TTS responses.
    - Validate the API and frontend integration for seamless interaction.

9. **Documentation and Presentation**
    - Prepare comprehensive documentation covering API integration, system architecture, and user workflow.
    - Create a demonstration to simulate typical drive-through order scenarios.

#### How to Use the Model
1. **Setup**
    - Download the `requirements.txt` file.
    - Run `app.py` in the backend.
    - Run `customer_details.html` in the frontend.

2. **Login**
    - Fill in user credentials on the login page.
    - Access the menu page upon successful login.

3. **Voice Ordering**
    - Click the microphone button on the menu page to start recording the order.
    - Repeat for additional items if necessary.

By following these steps, the Drive-In Assistant will provide an efficient and user-friendly ordering experience at KFC drive-throughs.




### Text-to-Speech (TTS) using SpeechT5 with HiFi-GAN Vocoder
This Python script demonstrates a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using the SpeechT5 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. It loads the model and vocoder, processes text input, generates speech, and saves the output to a WAV file. The script uses logging to track module loading and model loading times for performance monitoring.

## Key Components:
- Module Loading: Imports necessary libraries (torch, soundfile, transformers, datasets) and logs the time taken for module importation.
- Model Loading: Loads the SpeechT5 model and HiFi-GAN vocoder from the Hugging Face model hub, logging the time taken for model initialization.
- Text Processing: Converts input text into speech using the loaded model and vocoder.
- Logging: Utilizes logging to record detailed information about module loading, model loading, and speech generation processes.

## Dependencies:
- torch: PyTorch library for tensor computations.
- soundfile: Library for reading and writing sound files.
- transformers: Hugging Face's library for NLP and deep learning.
- datasets: Hugging Face's library for accessing and managing datasets.

## Usage:
- **Install Dependencies:** Ensure dependencies are installed by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **Python Version:** This script is compatible with Python version 3.8.10.
- **Run Script:** Execute the script to record, preprocess, and transcribe audio:
```
python TTS.py
```
- **Logging Setup:** Configure logging to tts_log.txt file with timestamps (%(asctime)s), log levels (%(levelname)s), and detailed messages (%(message)s).
- **Run Script:** Execute the script (python script.py) to generate speech from the provided text input and save it as speech.wav.

This script provides a streamlined approach to convert text into speech using state-of-the-art neural network models, offering flexibility for various TTS applications.
